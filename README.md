# MMT
Application for getting order information for customers

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

Net Core 3.0 SDK 

Post URL
https://localhost:44332/Order/GetMostRecentOrder


Security concerns:
ApiKey probably should not be sent as a url parameter for security issues.

Tasks before API is deployed:
Integration tests.
Where is it going to be deployed? 
Set up a deployment pipeline.
